Tricks of the Trade to be an Apache Spark Rock Star - Ted Malaska

Many tricks not applicable as we have very short jobs , i.e. few to one stages. So no real point to checkpoint the job.

Nested types: i.e. use nested data for denormalized data, i.e. use nested data structures to model hierachical relationships among joined / denormalized data sets.

Big and Small: functions that affect all records/partitions and functions that affect only one partition.

wow, we could use multi-threading in the driver to proces the same RDD with two actions at the same time, e.g. df.count() and dr.write()
